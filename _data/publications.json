		"abstract": "We enable the estimation of the per-axon axial diffusivity from single encoding, strongly diffusion-weighted, pulsed gradient spin echo data. Additionally, we improve the estimation of the per-axon radial diffusivity compared to estimates based on spherical averaging. The use of strong diffusion weightings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to approximate the signal in white matter as the sum of the contributions from only axons. At the same time, spherical averaging leads to a major simplification of the modeling by removing the need to explicitly account for the unknown distribution of axonal orientations. However, the spherically averaged signal acquired at strong diffusion weightings is not sensitive to the axial diffusivity, which cannot therefore be estimated although needed for modeling axons — especially in the context of multi-compartmental modeling. We introduce a new general method for the estimation of both the axial and radial axonal diffusivities at strong diffusion weightings based on kernel zonal modeling. The method could lead to estimates that are free from partial volume bias with gray matter or other isotropic compartments. The method is tested on publicly available data from the MGH Adult Diffusion Human Connectome project. We report reference values of axonal diffusivities based on 34 subjects, and derive estimates of axonal radii from only two shells. The estimation problem is also addressed from the angle of the required data preprocessing, the presence of biases related to modeling assumptions, current limitations, and future possibilities.",

		"abstract": "In magnetic resonance imaging, the application of a strong diffusion weighting suppresses the signal contribu­ tions from the less diffusion-restricted constituents of the brain’s white matter, thus enabling the estimation of the transverse relaxation time T2 that arises from the more diffusion-restricted constituents such as the axons. However, the presence of cell nuclei and vacuoles can confound the estimation of the axonal T2, as diffusion within those structures is also restricted, causing the corresponding signal to survive the strong diffusion weighting. We devise an estimator of the axonal T2 based on the directional spherical variance of the strongly diffusion-weighted signal. The spherical variance T2 estimates are insensitive to the presence of isotropic con­ tributions to the signal like those provided by cell nuclei and vacuoles. We show that with a strong diffusion weighting these estimates differ from those obtained using the directional spherical mean of the signal which contains both axonal and isotropically-restricted contributions. Our findings hint at the presence of an MRIvisible isotropically-restricted contribution to the signal in the white matter ex vivo fixed tissue (monkey) at 7T, and do not allow us to discard such a possibility also for in vivo human data collected with a clinical 3T system.",
