I'm currently a 1st-year PhD student in Visual Computing, DTU Compute. My specialization is Computer Graphics, specifically geometry processing. I focus on synthesizing realistic micro-environments efficiently. Generated data could be used to evaluate the biophysical models of diffusion MRI (dMRI).
