My research interests include 3D Image Processing, Computational & Experimental Neuroscience, and Applied Machine Learning.

Currently, I am working on a project titled "Mapping the Connectome of the Rodent Brain using Chemical Label-Free Optical Neuroimaging," funded by the Lundbeck Foundation in Denmark. My focus is on analysing light sheet microscopy data to map the brain connectome of rodents at a micrometre-scale resolution, which is significantly higher than conventional diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging. My responsibilities include developing 3D image processing workflows using Python, integrating these workflows with open-source tools, and big data analysis using UNIX shell scripting.
