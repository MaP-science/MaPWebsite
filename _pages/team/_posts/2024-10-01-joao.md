I have a background in experimental psychology and behavioural neuroscience, with a focus on mechanisms underlying learning, memory, and altered emotionality in animal models. At the DRCMR, I am investigating how neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases affect brain function by disrupting the speed of neuronal communication.
