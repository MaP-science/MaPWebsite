Generally, my research focuses on engineering of practical methods for efficient and quantitative 3D/4D image analysis. The application areas are mainly of biological/biomedical/preclinical origin. The methodology include image- and geometry processing, shape analysis, tomographic reconstruction, image registration and segmentation.

Within the context of the MAP group, we work with micro- or nano-scopic imaging systems - e.g. tomography beamlines at synchrotron facilities - to observe "ground truth" anatomy. Here we need a variety of methods and tools to segment, extract and quantify anatomical information in a way that is relatable to what we can observe with in- or ex-vivo MRI.
