My work as a postdoc focusses on classification of cytoarchitecture of the cerebral cortex using MRI. The work combines multiparametric MRI and microCT with a deep learning model so that cytoarchitectural specifics can be inferred from the MRI alone. This work is preclinical, performed predominantly on mice. My aim is to use my expertise in MR Physics and sequence design to explore the limits of MR and synchrotron imaging to expand our knowledge of brain microstructure.
