Working at an intersection of physics and neuroscience, I exploit imaging modalities such as light-, electron- and x-ray microscopy, as well as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to explore the 3D morphologies of brain tissue structures. My objectives are twofold: to establish correlations between microstructure and functional measures of brain communication, and to develop diffusion MRI methods to characterise specific cellular features. Ultimately, I wish to advance our understanding of the brain’s structure-function relationship and develop non-invasive methods for ‘in vivo histology’ to diagnose and monitor neurodegenerative diseases in the clinic.
