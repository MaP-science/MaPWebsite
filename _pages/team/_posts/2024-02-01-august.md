I come from a background of electrical engineering and robotics. My PhD is about super-resolution of large-scale 3D data using deep neural networks. Currently, super-resolution is an image-enhancing technique primarily used for 2D images. The aim of my PhD is to contribute to the field of 3D super-resolution and to design super-resolution models which are able to handle large-scale 3d data samples.
