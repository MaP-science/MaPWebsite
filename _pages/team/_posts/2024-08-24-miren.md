I am PhD student specializing on the application and validation of quantitative and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The objective of my work is to characterize white matter in both preclinical and clinical settings.

The central theme of my PhD is the study of demyelinating diseases. These are conditions that result in the damage of the protective covering around nerve fibers, known as myelin. My work aims to characterize how the changes in the tissue microstructure influence the different modalities.
