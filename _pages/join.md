# Join Us

<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #e1e3e3;"> <!-- Add a faint horizontal line here -->

Our team is continuously growing and evolving, and we are always eager to welcome new members who share our passion for advancing research. There are opportunities to work both at the DRCMR and/or DTU.


Students, in particular, are encouraged to reach out not only to inquire about ongoing projects but also to share their own project ideas that align with our research goals. We highly value creativity and fresh perspectives, so we are open to discussing a range of possibilities. In addition, we actively seek collaborations with other researchers and institutions, believing that shared expertise can drive innovation even further. 


If you are interested in joining the team, exploring project opportunities, or collaborating with us, please feel free to reach out to Tim at [timd@drcmr.dk](mailto: timd@drcmr.dk) . We'd love to hear from you!
