### Objectives

The MAP group is a research lab based in the Captial Region of Denmark near Copenhagen. We aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of brain structure and its plasticity at various levels. This ranges from studying isolated tissue compartments, such as microstructures including cellular spaces, neurons, and cell membranes, to visualizing and statistically analyzing whole brain connectivity networks. The goal is to understand the impact of these structures and networks on both normal and disrupted brain function.

### Affliliations 
The Microstructure and Plasticity (MAP) group is split between two research faciliates: the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance based at Hvidovre Hospital and DTU Compute at the Danish Technical University.

### Research

We apply our research to clinical, pre-clinical, and cognitive research projects, as well as to clinical settings. To achieve this, we rely on expert knowledge from various research areas. This expertise is acquired through collaboration with colleagues at the DRCMR, DTU Compute, external members, and international partners working on diffusion MRI, scientific computing, and neuroanatomy.

You can find a more indepth overview of our research at our [Research page](research).
