## Objectives:

The MAP group is a research lab based in the Captial Region of Denmark near Copenhagen. We aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of brain structure and its plasticity at various levels. This ranges from studying isolated tissue compartments, such as microstructures including cellular spaces, neurons, and cell membranes, to visualizing and statistically analyzing whole brain connectivity networks. The goal is to understand the impact of these structures and networks on both normal and disrupted brain function.

## Affliliations: 
The Microstructure and Plasticity (MAP) group is split between two research faciliates: the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance based at Hvidovre Hospital and DTU Compute at the Danish Technical University.

## Research:

Our research focuses on developing non-invasive diffusion MRI and quantitative MRI techniques to push the limits of clinical microstructure imaging. We also use synchrotron imaging, such as X-ray Nano Holotomography (XNH), to quantify neuronal morphology and to map cytoarchitecture, and Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy for cell-type-specific labeling. Our work generates large multi-modal 3D datasets to be analysed, from which we construct multi-modal brain atlases. We develop biophysical models to quantify microstructure and machine learning-based models for axon, myelin and soma 3D segmentation and quantifications as well as for brain connectom mapping, such as tractography-based methods.

You can find a more indepth overview of our research at our [Research page](research).
