### OUR OBJECTIVES

The group aims for a basic-science understanding of brain structure and its plasticity on several levels, ranging from isolated tissue compartments (i.e. microstructure as cellular spaces, neuron, cell membranes) to visualisation and statistical analysis of whole brain connectivity networks, and its impact on normal and disrupted brain function.

Our research is subsequently applied to clinical, pre-clinical and cognitive research projects as well as to clinical settings. To fulfill this aim, expert knowledge from a broad range of research areas is essential and is obtained through collaboration with colleagues within the DRCMR, external members, as well as international collaboration with other groups working on diffusion MRI, scientific computing and neuroanatomy.
