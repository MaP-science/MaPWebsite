*Marco and Tim having a great time at ESMRMB in Barcelona! They ran an interactive machine learning session in the workshop, getting everyone involved in some hands-on learning. Big thanks to Miren for helping make it happen!*

*Today Mariam and Tim prepped fresh rat brain samples for cryo-EM. It's a race against the clock to avoid tissue degeneration, so they had to move quickly. Thanks to Mariam’s meticulous planning, and last weeks practice a minute-by-minute timeline was created - one that they actually managed to beat on the day!*

*Afterward, Tim headed over to CFIM for high-pressure freezing. The tiny, 2 mm diameter samples—each just 200 µm thick—were carefully placed on a special holder for the HPF machine. The entire process takes only 5 milliseconds, and then the samples are stored in cryo for long-term preservation until they're ready for osmium staining.*

*It was a long day, starting bright and early at 5 AM!*

*At ISMRM 2024 in Singapore, our team had an exciting time during the poster presentation sessions. Mario assisted Mariam with her virtual presentation on ‘Unravelling Microstructural Age-Related Changes In The Acoustic Radiations Through Advanced Diffusion MRI Analysis’, while Thina presented her poster on ‘Axonal Fraction Imaging On Clinical And Preclinical DMRI PGSE Data'*
