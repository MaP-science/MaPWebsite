### OVERALL RESEARCH AREAS

* Understanding of water and metabolic diffusion in individual isolated tissue compartments such as cellular spaces, neurons, cell membranes (pre-clinical and clinical)
* Active Imaging of tissue microstructure – Verification and validation of new optimised diffusion MRI sequence designs to probe new and specific tissue microstructures (clinical, pre-clinical)
* Imaging pipelines for high-quality and high-resolution (ex vivo and in vivo) diffusion MRI for studying tissue microstructure, method development and validation (pre-clinical)
* Tractography and mapping of brain connectivity – improve and extend existing approaches and relate to functional data (fMRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation).
* Brain plasticity including diseases such as multiple-sclerosis and traumatic brain injury (clinical and pre-clinical), brain maturation (pre-clinical), aging (clinical), and sensory deprivation such as blindness and deafness (clinical).
