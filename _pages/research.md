We use quantitative MRI techniques to investigate the microstructural properties of the brain. We combine diffusion, relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging to study the integrity of white matter tracts, the distribution of myelin and the cytoarchitecture of the brain in preclinical and clinical settings. These methods provide valuable insights into the underlying neurobiological processes in health and disease, with potential applications in neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric conditions, and developmental neuroscience.

We also focus on investigating early neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease by utilizing a combination of histology and advanced imaging techniques in a transgenic rat model. We employ immunofluorescence staining as a key method to visualize and analyze these early-stage alterations, allowing for a deeper understanding of the disease's progression. This approach enables us to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's, contributing to the development of potential therapeutic interventions

Unlike traditional microscopy, light-sheet (LS) microscopy is an advanced imaging technique that enables the visualization of entire biological specimens without sectioning. LS microscopy offers significant advantages, including minimal photodamage and high resolution on a micro-metre scale. This technique is particularly valuable in fields like developmental biology, neuroscience, and tissue engineering. Our work focuses on using LS microscopy to create a micro-metre scale connectome of rodents, which has potential applications in drug discovery, studying brain connections, metabolism, and more.

### Synchrotron Imaging for Quantification of Anatomical Features

</div>

We work with micro- or nano-scopic imaging systems - e.g. tomography beamlines at synchrotron facilities - to observe "ground truth" anatomy. Here we need a variety of methods and tools to segment, extract and quantify anatomical information in a way that is relatable to what we can observe with in- or ex-vivo MRI.
