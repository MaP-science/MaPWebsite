Enhancements in tractography and brain connectivity mapping aim to improve and extend current approaches. This includes efforts to better relate these structural connections to functional data obtained from techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of brain function.

Within the team we are actively developing novel high resolution MRI scan sequences with the aim of exploring tissue microstructure in the cerebral cortex, with an emphasis on the verification and validation of cytoarchitectural changes across disease progression. This research goes hand-in-hand with the work 
Active imaging techniques are employed to explore tissue microstructure, with an emphasis on the verification and validation of new and optimized diffusion MRI sequence designs. These techniques aim to probe specific and novel tissue microstructures, offering potential improvements in both clinical and pre-clinical imaging practices.

Developing and validating imaging pipelines for high-quality and high-resolution diffusion MRI is essential for studying tissue microstructure. These pipelines are crucial for both ex vivo and in vivo imaging, particularly in pre-clinical research, to advance method development and ensure the reliability of imaging results.

Unlike traditional microscopy, light-sheet (LS) microscopy is an advanced imaging technique that enables the visualization of entire biological specimens without sectioning. LS microscopy offers significant advantages, including minimal photodamage and high resolution on a micro-metre scale. This technique is particularly valuable in fields like developmental biology, neuroscience, and tissue engineering. Our work focuses on using LS microscopy to create a micro-metre scale connectome of rodents, which has potential applications in drug discovery, studying brain connections, metabolism, and more.
